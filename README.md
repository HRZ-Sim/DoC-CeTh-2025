# DoC-CeTh-2025
This repository contains scripts for analyzing both empirical clinical data and simulated CeTh activity using a conductance-based model, as detailed in our study, "A Shared Central Thalamus Mechanism Underlying Diverse Recoveries in Disorders of Consciousness." Below, you will find a detailed description of each folder, its functionality, and the necessary software environment and dependencies.

[General Requirements]

MATLAB Version: R2023b

Recommended: Due to the intensive computation required, especially for the simulation part, it is advised to run these scripts on a server.

[Repository Structure]

1. Empirical analysis/

This folder contains scripts for processing and analyzing empirical CeTh recordings to select and evaluate features.

-Main_pipline.m: 

    Main function orchestrating the feature selection pipeline across five steps, loading sample data from step1_sampleData.mat.
    
-organizeAllCeThfeatures.m:

    Organizes and displays all raw features.
    
-Step1_clusteringFeatures.m:

    Clusters features based on high similarity.
    
-Step2_filteredFeatureSelection.m: 

    Filters features by significance, effect size, or Fisher scores.
    
-Step3_EmbeddedFeatureSelection.m: 

    Applies Lasso regularization for embedded feature selection.
    
% linear SVM: using the liblinear-2.43

% LIBSVM page: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm

-Step4_FeatureAggregation.m: 

    Aggregates features with high weights.
    
-Step5_WrapperFeatureSelection.m: 

    Iterates through feature combinations to identify the final optimal selections.
    
-organizefeatures_finalCeThmetric,m:

    Organizes and displays the final chosen optimal features.

Subfolders:

Empirical analysis/Intermediate results/Step3_Modelresults/: Stores model classification results from step 3.

Empirical analysis/Intermediate results/Step5_Modelresults/: Stores model classification results from step 5.

Empirical analysis/scriptFunction/: Contains utility functions supporting various scripts:

-func_FisherScore.m: 

    Calculates Fisher's score.
    
-F1score.m: 

    Calculates F1 score.

-transz.m: 

    Translates output of linkage in the clustering part.
    
-updatingfeatureName.m and nameUpdate.m: 

    Standardize feature naming across different script versions.







2. Simulation/

This folder contains scripts for simulating conditions and analyzing simulated CeTh activity.

-Main.m: 

    Main function that coordinates the following simulation tasks:
    
-task1_draw_ExampleForTonicAndLTB.m

    Example Drawing for Tonic and LTB. Visualizes spiking activity of the network under deafferented and normal conditions.
    
-task2_draw_ScandeaffRatio.m

    Scanning Deafferented Neuron Ratio. Explores the effects of varying the proportion of deafferented neurons within the network.
    
-task3_draw_ScanaffMag.m

    Scanning Afferent Magnitude. Analyzes how different levels of residual afferent input affect the network.
    
-task5_draw_4stagesPSD.m

    Scanning  through four different stages of consciousness (I, II, III, IV) as defined in the Method Section. This script evaluates the networkâ€™s response across these stages, helping to elucidate the neural correlates of varying conscious states.
    
-task6_saveResults.m

    Save results from Task6 for further analysis.
    
-task6_draw_scanaffMagANDaffStab.m

    Scanning Afferent Magnitude and Stability. Explore and visualize the combined effects of afferent input magnitude and stability on network behavior.
    
-task6_draw_2DimModchanges.m

    Visualizes the distribution of simulated CeTh activity under different states of consciousness in two dimensions: the power and stability of the theta rhythm. and drawing parallels with empirical distributions.

Subfolders:

Simulation/Task1~6/:

/Task1/: Stores the settings for two types of neuronal input (Poisson spike train). Additionally, W_N100.mat is the initial connectivity matrix used in the simulations.

/Task2~6/: Each folder stores the results from 100 trials of simulations performed on a server for each respective task.

Simulation/scriptFunction/: Contains utility functions for simulation:

-func_simulating.m: The main function for iterative simulation modeling.

-func_checkPlotINEllipse.m, func_smoothDots.m, func_interpolation.m: Support task6_draw_2DimModchanges.m.
